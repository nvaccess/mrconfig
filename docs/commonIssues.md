# Common Issues

Descriptions for, and fixes for common issues with the translation system.

## No stable branch:
Cron email with message:
`Warning: this addon has no stable branch, aborting.`

The addon repo must have a branch called `stable`.

Docs: https://github.com/nvdaaddons/nvdaaddons.github.io/wiki/MakeAddonsTranslatable

Corresponding check for branch: `hasStableBranchOrDie` in `01_common.sh`


### Missing po file:

Cron email with message:
```
<lang ID> wants <addon name>: 1
Already available for translation, merging in new messages.
translate.tools.pocount: ERROR: cannot process <lang ID>/add-ons/<addon name>/nvda.po: does not exist
translate.tools.pocount: ERROR: cannot process <lang ID>/add-ons/<addon name>/nvda.po: does not exist
msgmerge: error while opening "<lang ID>/add-ons/<addon name>/nvda.po" for reading: No such file or directory
```

The po file is missing. Perhaps it was deleted accidentally or the translator decided they would not translate for the add-on.

Scripts are being updated to handle this case. The file will be re-added. If the translator no longer wants to work on this add-on, the settings file should be updated to reflect that instead. 


### Addon removed from addonFiles

Cron email with message:
```
/bin/sh: 1: cd: can't cd to /home/nvdal10n/mr/addons/<addon name>
```

Check if the `available.d/10_<addon name>` file has been removed but the entry in `automatic.crontab` was not removed.
To fix, remove the entry from `automatic.crontab`.

Check if the case of the repo `/home/nvdal10n/mr/addons/<addon name>` matches the entry in `automatic.crontab`, if not fix the case.

### Missing 'msgstr' section

Cron email with message:
```
Already available for translation, merging in new messages.
<lang>/add-ons/<addon name>/nvda.po:66: missing 'msgstr' section
msgmerge: found 1 fatal error
```
An entry in the file (at the line specified) is missing the msgstr section.
To fix this add an empty string for the msgstr.
EG:
```
#. Translators: the tooltip text for a menu item.
msgid "Shows a dictionary dialog to customize emoticons"
msgstr ""
```
This needs to be done in the SRT repository.


### Po file missing

Error text:
```
Wanted, but po file is missing, restoring file.
cp: cannot stat '/tmp/DirectLink.pot': No such file or directory
mr addon2svn: command failed
```

Common cause: Case differences between repo name and addon name.
E.G., DirectLink repo has addon name directLink
In `buildvars.py` the `addon_name` is "directLink", this creates a "directLink.pot" file.
Our scripts rely on the add-on repository folder matching the add-on name.

Fix: rename the local addon repository to match the addonName.
- `cd mr/addons/`
- `mv DirectLink/ directLink`
- `cd ../available.d/`
- `git mv 10_DirectLink 10_directLink`
- Edit `10_directLink` change `[addons/DirectLink]` to `[addons/directLink]`
- `cd ../enabled.d/`
- `rm 10_DirectLink`
- `ln -s ../available.d/10_directLink`
- `cd ../` 
- Edit `automatic.crontab` fix case for addon entry.
- `mr up` check for errors for modified addon
- `git add automatic.crontab available.d/10_directLink`
- `git commit -m "rename addon repo"`
- `git push`
- `cd addons/directLink/`
- **Warning:**
  This step could result in data loss if the new name already exists.
  First ensure there are no other changes in the srt repo (`svn status`) to allow easy revert (`svn revert --recursive .`) 
  This creates new entries for the new name, using the values for the oldname, then deletes the oldname.
  If either the new name of the old name key have value '1' (translator wants to translate this addon)
  then 1 is set. See `.sh.d/01_addon2svn.sh` function `renameAddonInSetting`
  - `mr renameAddonInSettings DirectLink` 
  - `cd ../../srt`
  - `svn diff */settings | less` Manually inspect the files, use revert is outcome is not as expected.
  - `svn commit */settings -m "Make <addonName> add-on available for translation."`


### Unable to checkout stable due to local changes

```
Running addon2svn for charInfo
Saved working directory and index state On master: 2021-07-21 at 09:52:15 on master before switching to stable branch
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        addon/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting

```
When running `git diff` from the `mr/addons/<addonName>` directory, many lines like:
```
diff --git a/addon/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po b/addon/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po
index f6cec9b..b7bb9f4 100644

 This is caused by a filter to prevent these lines from changing regularly (updating line numbers), and causing conflicts.
 - Disable the filter by commenting it out (`vim ~/.gitconfig`) add a '#' to comment.
 - `git checkout stable`
 - `git status`
 - Enable the filter `vim ~/.gitconfig` again.
 - `git status`
 
### Files have incorrect encoding

This can be confirmed by running `file`.

Example:
```sh
$ file /home/nvdal10n/mr/srt/ar/userGuide.t2t
/home/nvdal10n/mr/srt/ar/userGuide.t2t: data
```

Expected output is UTF-8 such as:
```sh
$ file /home/nvdal10n/mr/srt/ar/userGuide.t2t
/home/nvdal10n/mr/srt/ar/userGuide.t2t: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators
```

One approach to fix this is with a rudimentary binary search.

1. Copy the file locally
1. Open a wsl terminal
1. Split the file into 10 files, prefixed by "A": `split -n 10 userGuideCopy.t2t A`
1. Check the encoding of each file: `file A*`
1. Pick a file with data as the encoding (example, assume `Aab` has data encoding)
1. Check the length of the file to determine an appropriate split: `wc -l Aab`
1. Split the file as appropriate, repeating 4-6 while incrementing the prefix alphabetically: `split -n N Aab B`
1. Manually inspect the single line on the final file to find any non UTF-8 characters.
